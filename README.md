# bxl pswd gen. (ai generated)

yo what is this 💀  
this is a goofy ahh password generator  
made for people who say “yeah my password is strong” and then use `123456`

---

## what does this thing even do

- generates random passwords like a casino machine 🎰  
- checks if your password got exposed in data leaks (oops)  
- looks dark, minimal, mysterious, sigma 😎  
- has a button that goes *info.* and then trauma dumps  
- made by ai (real)


## why does this exist

idk man  
i was bored  
now it exists  
you’re welcome


## how to use (very hard)

1. open the exe  
2. click generate  
3. feel powerful  
4. click check leaks  
5. feel fear  
6. copy password  
7. pretend you’re secure now  

## warning ⚠️

- if your password is found in leaks  
  that’s not my fault  
- if it isn’t  
  congrats you’re slightly less doomed

## info button lore

pressing the info button reveals:
- developer backstory  
- questionable life choices  
- a github link  
- “made by ai.” because why not

## github or whatever

github.com/veryverybadly  

don’t ask what’s in there  
even i don’t know

## final words

this software will not:
- fix your life  
- make you rich  
- bring her back  

but it **will** generate a password
